## 1.1 MongoDB 哲学

MongoDB offers durability when used in tandem with at least two data-bearing servers as part of a three-node cluster. This is the recommended minimum for production deployments. MongoDB also supports the concept of “write concerns.” This is where a given number of nodes can be made to confirm the write wassuccessful, giving a stronger guarantee that the data are safely stored.
Single server durability is ensured since version 1.8 of MongoDB with a transaction log. This log is append only and is flushed to disk every 100 milliseconds.

BSON also adds a couple  of features that aren’t available in standard JSON, including a number of extended types for numeric data (such as int32 and int64) and support for handling binary data.

The 32-bit version of MongoDB is limited to databases of 2GB or less. This is because MongoDB uses memory-mapped files internally to achieve high performance.

## 1.3 功能列表

### WiredTiger
MongoDB 引入可插拔的数据存储 API 和 WiredTiger，一个高性能的数据库引擎。WiredTiger MongoDB 3.2 的默认的引擎。WiredTiger 比经典的 MMAP (memory-mapped) 存储引擎更高效。
WiredTiger allows MongoDB to (among other things) far better optimize what data reside in memory and what data reside on disk. WiredTiger also better optimizes how data are stored on disk and provides an in-built compression API that makes for massive savings on disk space.

引入 WiredTiger 是 MongoDB 的重大进步，不亚于 MongoDB 的首次出现。

### BSON

BSON不一定比等价的JSON空间占用更小。

MongoDB 的首要目标是快，而不是空间效率。为了快增加部分空间开销。BSON 查询起来非常快，索引起来非常快。Although BSON requires slightly more disk space than JSON, this extra space is unlikely to be a problem, because disks are inexpensive, and MongoDB can scale across machines. The WiredTiger storage engine supports multiple compression libraries and has index and data compression enabled by default. Compression level can be set at a per-server default as well as per-collection (on creation). Higher levels of compression will use more CPU when data are stored but can result in a significant disk space savings.

The second key benefit to using BSON is that it is easy and quick to convert BSON to a programming language’s native data format. If the data were stored in pure JSON, a relatively high-level conversion would need to take place.

BSON 扩展了 JSON 的数据类型，如二进制。

### Updating Information In Place (Memory Mapped Database Only)

当数据更新一行数据，有多重选择。Many databases choose the multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) approach, which allows multiple users to see different versions of the data. This approach is useful because it ensures that the datawon’t be changed partway through by another program during a given transaction. 去诶单是数据需要追踪数据的多个拷贝。
MongoDB, on the other hand, updates information in place. 一般不需要额外分配空间，索引也不需要修改。该方法的另一个好处是，MongoDB 延迟写。仅在必须的时候写磁盘，一般每100毫秒。如果数据在一秒内被多次修改，如计数器，写磁盘是受控制的。
**代价是数据不能保证存储到磁盘上**。因此管理关键数据仍适用传统 RDBMS。

### 存储二进制数据

BSON最多支持 16MB 的二进制数据。
GridFS is MongoDB’s solution to storing binary data in the database. GridFS works by storing the information about the file (called metadata) in the `files` collection The data themselves are broken down into pieces called `chunks` that are stored in the chunks collection. This approach makes storing data both easy and scalable; it also makes range operations (such as retrieving specific parts of a file) much easier to use.
GridFS 一般是驱动使用的，一般必须要你直接打交道。

### 复制（Replicating）

MongoDB 选择不实现 RDBMS 数据库的某些特性，原因有：会减慢数据库速度；增加程序复杂性；服务器最常见的问题是硬件，此时即使数据已安全存入磁盘也无济于事。
当然，这不意味着安全不重要。MongoDB 保证安全的方式是主从复制（master-slave replication）。

某一时刻只有一个数据库用来写。基础的主从复制现在已经启用了，改用 replica sets。Replica sets 有一个 primary 服务器（类似于 master)，负责处理客户端的所有写请求。When a write occurs, it is logged in the primary’s oplog.
secondary 服务器通过复制 oplog 实现与 primary 的同步。

primary 宕机后，replica set 中剩下的机器投票决定其中之一作为 primary。应用驱动会自动侦测 replica set 配置或状态的变化，重新建立连接。

### 分片（Sharding）
MongoDB 能够自动分片。MongoDB 自己会负责数据的分隔和合并；负责数据写到正确的机器，查询以最优的方式运行和组合。In fact, from a developer’s point of view, there is no difference between talking to a MongoDB database with a hundred shards and talking to a single MongoDB server.

### Map-Reduce
MongoDB doesn’t require that you use map and reduce functions. In fact, MongoDB relies on a simple querying syntax that is more akin to what you see in MySQL.

The map and reduce functions are written in JavaScript and run on the server.

### 聚合框架
MapReduce 的问题是性能不是特别高。

With the aggregation framework, a large number of operators are provided that are written in C++ and are highly performant. 且随着新版本发布会增加更多的运算符和新供。

聚合框架基于 pipeline。
