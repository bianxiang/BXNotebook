### 5.5 内存管理

内存管理师自动的。引用类型的内存管理在表面之下还是挺复杂的。底层机制将在第12章详细讨论。Even for the Swift user, things can occasionally go wrong in this regard. (Value types do not require the sort of complex memory management that reference types do, so no memory management issues can arise for them.)

问题一般由于两个类实例相互引用。When that’s the case, you can have a retain cycle which will result in a memory leak, 即两个实例永远不会消失。一些语言解决该问题的方法是通过周期性的垃圾收集阶段，侦测retain cycles并清理。但Swift不会，你只能手工避免（fend off）retain cycles。

The way to test for and observe a memory leak is to implement a class’s `deinit`. This method is called when the instance goes out of existence. If the instance never goes out of existence, `deinit` is never called. That’s a bad sign, if you were expecting that the instance should go out of existence.

Here’s an example. First, I’ll make two class instances and watch them go out of existence:

```
func testRetainCycle() {
    class Dog {
        deinit {
        	println("farewell from Dog")
        }
    }
    class Cat {
        deinit {
        	println("farewell from Cat")
        }
    }
    let d = Dog()
    let c = Cat()
}
testRetainCycle() // farewell from Cat, farewell from Dog
```

Now I’ll change that code by giving the Dog and Cat objects references to each other:

```
func testRetainCycle() {
    class Dog {
        var cat : Cat? = nil
        deinit {
            println("farewell from Dog")
        }
    }
    class Cat {
        var dog : Dog? = nil
        deinit {
        	println("farewell from Cat")
        }
    }
    let d = Dog()
    let c = Cat()
    d.cat = c // create a…
    c.dog = d // ...retain cycle
}
testRetainCycle() // nothing in console
```

When we run that code, neither “farewell” message appears in the console. These objects are therefore now leaking. Our code is over; both d and c are gone. There are no further references to either of these objects; neither object can ever be referred to again. No code can mention them; no code can reach them. But they live on, floating, useless, and taking up memory.

#### 5.5.1 弱引用

解决 retain cycle 的一个方案是将由问题的引用标记为 `weak`。The object referred to can now go out of existence even while the referrer continues to exist. 只有一个 Optional 引用才能标记为 `weak`。若背后对象被销毁，引用变成 nil。为此，引用必须是 var 引用。

Thus, this code breaks the retain cycle and prevents the memory leak:

```
func testRetainCycle() {
    class Dog {
        weak var cat : Cat? = nil
        deinit {
        	println("farewell from Dog")
        }
    }
    class Cat {
        weak var dog : Dog? = nil
        deinit {
        	println("farewell from Cat")
        }
    }
    let d = Dog()
    let c = Cat()
    d.cat = c
    c.dog = d
}
testRetainCycle() // farewell from Cat, farewell from Dog
```

尽管值类型不像引用类型由内存管理问题，但结构的实例可以与一个类的实例有 retain cycle 关系。例如若 Dog 是类，Cat 是结构，仍会存在 retain cycle。解决方法相同：让 Cat 的 `dog` 变成弱引用。无法将 Dog 的 `cat` 做成若引用，因为 Cat 是结构，只有到类类型的引用可以声明为 `weak`。

除非必要，不要用若引用。但现实中，有些时候，不是为了消除 retain cycle，也要。例如，视图控制器中，对根视图下的子视图的引用一般为弱引用，因为根视图自身已经对这些子视图有强引用了，当根视图不存在时，没必要让子视图继续存在：

```
class HelpViewController: UIViewController {
    weak var wv : UIWebView? = nil
    override func viewWillAppear(animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)
        let wv = UIWebView(frame:self.view.bounds)
        // ... further configuration of wv here…
        self.view.addSubview(wv)
        self.wv = wv
    }
    // ...
}
```

#### 5.5.2 无主的（Unowned）引用

处理 retain cycles 有第二种方法。将引用标记为 `unowned`。This approach is useful in special cases where one object absolutely cannot exist without a reference to another, but where this reference need not be a persisting reference.

例如，Boy 可以有也可以没有 Dog，但每个 Dog 必须有一个 Boy。用 `unowned` 解决循环引用：

```
func testUnowned() {
    class Boy {
    var dog : Dog? = nil
        deinit {
        	println("farewell from Boy")
        }
    }
    class Dog {
        unowned let boy : Boy // *
        init(boy:Boy) { self.boy = boy }
        deinit {
        	println("farewell from Dog")
        }
    }
    let b = Boy()
    let d = Dog(boy: b)
    b.dog = d
}
testUnowned() // farewell from Boy, farewell from Dog
```

unowned 引用的好处是不必是 Optional（其实是“不能是”）；可以是常量（let）。使用 unowned 引用是危险的，若对象在后台消失，尝试使用引用将导致崩溃，例子：

```
var b = Optional(Boy())
let d = Dog(boy: b!)
b = nil // destroy the Boy behind the Dog's back
println(d.boy) // crash
```


Thus, you should use unowned only if you are absolutely certain that the object referred to will outlive the referrer.

#### 5.5.3 匿名函数中的若引用和无主引用

retain cycle的一个变体，when an instance property’s value is a function referring to the instance:

```
class FunctionHolder {
    var function : (Void -> Void)? = nil
    deinit {
    	println("farewell from FunctionHolder")
    }
}
func testFunctionHolder() {
    let f = FunctionHolder()
    f.function = {
    	println(f)
    }
}
testFunctionHolder() // nothing in console
```

Oooops! I’ve created a retain cycle, by referring, inside the anonymous function, to the object that is holding a reference to it. 由于函数闭包，匿名函数捕获 `f`，是一个强引用。但 `function` 属性也是一个强引用，因此是一个循环引用。

In this situation, I cannot break the retain cycle by declaring the `function` property as weak or unowned. 只有到类类型的引用可以是 weak 或 unowned，但函数不是类。因此我只能将匿名函数中捕获到的 `f` 做成 weak 或 unowned。

解决此问题需要特有的语法。At the very start of the anonymous function body, where the **in** line would go (and before the in line if there is one), you put square brackets containing a comma-separated list of any problematic class type references that will be captured from the surrounding environment, each reference preceded by `weak` or `unowned`. This list is called a capture list. If you have a capture list, you must follow it by the keyword in if you are not already including the keyword in for other reasons. Thus:

```
class FunctionHolder {
    var function : (Void -> Void)? = nil
    deinit {
    	println("farewell from FunctionHolder")
    }
    }
    func testFunctionHolder() {
        let f = FunctionHolder()
        f.function = {
        	[weak f] in
        println(f)
    }
}
testFunctionHolder() // farewell from FunctionHolder
```

This syntax solves the problem. But marking a reference as weak in a capture list has a mild side effect that you will need to be aware of: 引用变成了 Optional。But of course you must also adjust your code accordingly, unwrapping the Optional as needed in order to use it. The usual technique is to perform the weak–strong dance: you unwrap the Optional once, right at the start of the function, in a conditional binding, thus creating a new scope in which there is a normal (non-Optional) reference.

Everything else in the anonymous function is embedded in that scope:

```
class FunctionHolder {
    var function : (Void -> Void)? = nil
    deinit {
    	println("farewell from FunctionHolder")
    }
}
func testFunctionHolder() {
    let f = FunctionHolder()
    f.function = { // here comes the weak–strong dance
    	[weak f] in // weak
    	if let f = f { // strong
    		println(f)
    	}
    }
}
testFunctionHolder() // farewell from FunctionHolder
```

The conditional binding `let f = f` accomplishes two goals. First, it unwraps the Optional version of f that arrived into the anonymous function. Second, it is a normal (strong) reference. So if the unwrapping succeeds, this new `f` will persist for the rest of the embedded scope.
In that particular example, there is no way on earth that this FunctionHolder instance, `f`, can go out of existence while the anonymous function lives on. There are no other references to the anonymous function; it persists only as a property of `f`. Therefore I can avoid some behind-the-scenes bookkeeping overhead, as well as the weak–strong dance, by declaring f as unowned in my capture list instead.

In real life, my own most frequent use of `unowned` is precisely in this context. Very often, the reference marked as `unowned` in the capture list will be self. Here’s an example from my own code:

```
class MyDropBounceAndRollBehavior : UIDynamicBehavior {
    let v : UIView
    init(view v:UIView) {
    	self.v = v
    	super.init()
    }
    override func willMoveToAnimator(anim: UIDynamicAnimator!) {
        if anim == nil { return }
        let sup = self.v.superview!
        let grav = UIGravityBehavior()
        grav.action = {
        	[unowned self] in
        	let items = anim.itemsInRect(sup.bounds) as [UIView]
        	if find(items, self.v) == nil {
                anim.removeBehavior(self)
                self.v.removeFromSuperview()
        	}
        }
        self.addChildBehavior(grav)
        grav.addItem(self.v)
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

There’s a potential (and rather elaborate) retain cycle here: `self.addChildBehavior(grav)` causes a persistent reference to grav, grav has a persistent reference to grav.action, and the anonymous function assigned to `grav.action` refers to self. To break the retain cycle, I declare the reference to self as unowned in the anonymous function’s capture list.

#### 5.5.4 Memory Management of Protocol-Typed References

Only a reference to an instance of a class type can be declared weak or unowned. A reference to an instance of a struct or enum type cannot be so declared, because its memory management doesn’t work the same way (and is not subject to retain cycles).

因此协议类型的引用就有问题了。A protocol might be adopted by a struct or an enum. Therefore you cannot wantonly declare such a reference weak or unowned. You can only declare a protocol-typed reference weak or unowned if it is a class protocol — 即，它标记了 `@objc` 或 `class`。

In this code, `SecondViewControllerDelegate` is a protocol that I’ve declared. This code won’t compile unless `SecondViewControllerDelegate` is declared as a class protocol:

```
class SecondViewController : UIViewController {
    weak var delegate : SecondViewControllerDelegate?
    // ...
}
```

Here’s the actual declaration of `SecondViewControllerDelegate`; it is declared as a **class** protocol, and that’s why the preceding code is legal:

```
protocol SecondViewControllerDelegate : class {
	func acceptData(data:AnyObject!)
}
```

A protocol declared in Objective-C is implicitly marked as `@objc` and is a class protocol. Thus, this declaration from my real-life code is legal:
`weak var delegate : WKScriptMessageHandler?`

`WKScriptMessageHandler` is a protocol declared by Cocoa (in particular, by the Web Kit framework). Thus, it is implicitly marked `@objc`; only a class can adopt `WKScriptMessageHandler`, and so the compiler is satisfied that the delegate variable will be an instance of a class, and thus the reference can be treated as weak.
