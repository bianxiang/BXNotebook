# 6 Programmatic Views

In this chapter, you will update **WorldTrotter** to create the view for `MapViewController` programmatically. In doing so, you will learn more about view controllers and how to set up constraints and controls (such as `UIButton`) programmatically.

第一步，手工创建 `MapViewController` 的 `view`。

In Main.storyboard, select the map view associated with **Map View Controller** and press Delete.

## 6.1 通过代码创建视图

手工创建视图需要覆盖 `UIViewController` 的 `loadView()` 方法。
```swift
import UIKit
import MapKit
class MapViewController : UIViewController {
	var mapView: MKMapView!
	override func loadView() {
		// Create a mapview
		mapView = MKMapView()
		// Set it as *the* view of this view controller
		view = mapView
	}
	override func viewDidLoad() {
		super.viewDidLoad()
		print("MapView Controller loaded its view.")
	}
}
```
If a view controller is asked for its view and its view is `nil`, then the `loadView()` method is called.
