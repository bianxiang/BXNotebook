### Application Fundamentals

http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html

The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.

It's possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID, in which case they are able to access each other's files. To conserve system resources, apps with the same user ID can also arrange to run in the same Linux process and share the same VM (the apps must also be signed with the same certificate).
