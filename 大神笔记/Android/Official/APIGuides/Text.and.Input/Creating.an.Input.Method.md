# 创建新输入法

一个*input method editor (IME)*是一个用户控件，允许用户输入文本。Android provides an extensible input method framework that allows applications to provide users alternative input methods, such as on-screen keyboards or even speech input. Once installed, users can select which IME they want to use from the system settings and use it across the entire system; only one IME may be enabled at a time.
