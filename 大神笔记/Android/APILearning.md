# Activity

## 方法

* `boolean android.app.Activity.isFinishing()`  
Check to see whether this activity is in the process of finishing, either because you called finish() on it or someone else has requested that it finished. This is often used in onPause() to determine whether the activity is simply pausing or completely finishing.
