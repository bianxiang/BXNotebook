## 16 模板与泛型编程

Both object-oriented programming (OOP) and generic programming deal with types that are not known at the time the program is written. The distinction between the two is that OOP deals with types that are not known until run time, whereas in generic programming the types become known during compilation.

The containers, iterators, and algorithms described in Part II are all examples of generic programming. When we write a generic program, we write the code in a way that is independent of any particular type.
