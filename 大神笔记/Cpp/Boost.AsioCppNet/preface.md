In order to read the book, you should be familiar with the core Boost libraries, such as Boost Smart Pointers, boost::noncopyable, Boost Functors, Boost Bind, shared_from_this / enabled_shared_from_this, and Boost Threading (threads and mutexes). A bit of familiarity with Boost Date/Time is required as well. Readers should also be familiar with the concept of blocking versus "non-blocking" operations.
